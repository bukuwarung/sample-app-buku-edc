## 1. Implementation
- [x] 1.1 Add Transfer flow routes and navigation wiring using single-activity navigation.
- [x] 1.2 Build Transfer screens in the Figma order with mock data only (no receipt screen).
- [x] 1.3 Create Hilt-injected ViewModels for each Transfer screen and wire UI state/events.
- [x] 1.4 Update Home Transfer action to navigate into the flow while other actions keep toast feedback.
- [x] 1.5 Add previews and supporting resources (strings, icons) as needed.

## 2. Validation
- [x] 2.1 Manual: Tap Transfer on Home, verify each primary button advances to the next screen and the final screen returns to Home.
- [x] 2.2 Manual: Tap non-Transfer actions on Home, confirm toast feedback still appears.
